These are the scripts to generate the websites on http://modules.perl6.org/.
Intial version contributed by patrickas++.

This directory now lives in the root directory of the gh-pages branch, and will
probably be removed soon.

To run the scripts you need a GitHub token with rights to query Perl6 module GitHub repository information.
Please find more information about GitHub tokens here:
https://github.com/blog/1509-personal-api-tokens

HowTo:
* Create a token with access to public repositories
* Save the token in file named 'github-token'
* Place the github-token in the same directory as the Perl scripts
